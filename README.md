Web Development API Task

Node application for user manipulation using simple CRUD

----------------------------RUNNING THE CODE --------------------------

note: I have been using POSTMAN to test my route calls. Folder is attatched if you would like to view this (postmanRoutes)

I have saved all dependancies to my package.json so a simple npm install should config everything.

Run node server.js in terminal.
It should then start running on 'localhost:/8080'

Id advise to run a simple mongod server from the command line port 27017

All routes are listed in my server.js

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Please note: only recently been playing with ES6 so understand if there are some core aspects that could be wrong
would really appreciate if any bad practises or habits could be pointed out. Also, if you feel that my implementation
is lacking in any way. Send it back to me and I can assure you I will make the changes necessary.

If you have any questions about my code, email: sambowenhughes@hotmail.co.uk
